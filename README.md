# Quiz Generator

**Quiz Generator** is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models to automatically generate interactive, exam-style questions (with answers) based on your notes. Whether you're a student looking to quiz yourself or an educator creating assessments, this plugin streamlines the question creation process.

## Features
- **Personalized Questions:** Select any combination of notes and folders to use as the quiz content.

- **Interactive UI:** Answer generated questions in an interactive UI that provides real-time feedback on correctness.
- **Question Saving:** Save your generated questions in either (or both) of the following formats.
  - Inline and multiline flashcards to review with [obsidian-spaced-repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition).
  - Markdown callouts for seamless integration with your notes.
- **Model Options:** Choose between OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, depending on your needs.
  - Use `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` (16,385 token context window) for faster response times and efficient question generation with a moderate context window.
